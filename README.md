The dot product of matrices, also known as the matrix inner product or matrix multiplication, is a fundamental operation in linear algebra with numerous applications across mathematics, engineering, computer science, and various scientific fields. Unlike the element-wise multiplication of matrices, which involves multiplying corresponding elements, the dot product of matrices combines the rows of one matrix with the columns of another to produce a new matrix.
